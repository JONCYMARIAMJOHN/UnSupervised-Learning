# UnSupervised-Learning
A python project to evaluate the application of clustering techniques (KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering) on the Iris dataset from the sklearn library. This project involves data preprocessing, implementing two clustering algorithms, visualizing the resulting clusters and comparing the clustering results

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which is part of the sklearn library. This dataset contains 150 samples, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), representing different types of iris flowers. 

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering on the Iris dataset, showing distinct groupings that align with the inherent structure of the data.
